# Ecoleta
Next Level Week 1.0 - Rocketseat - Projeto: Ecoleta.

NLW is a practical workshop offered by Rocketseat with lots of learning, code, challenges and networking with a single goal => to take you to a next level!

In this first edition, we develped a #full stack application# (Frontend and Backend). This website is a marketplace and brings together the people and the recycle points. It is possible to (i) create new recycle points, (ii) search for a recycle point, and others interactions.

Thanks Rocketseat for this amazing week!
